### RED Indicator Triage

| Indicator | Root Cause | Resolution |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Nightly Test Suite** | Issues #10435, #10436 already closed. New run 25022916512 in progress | Wait — previous failures on stale commit |
| **Playwright E2E** | 5 tests fail (sidebar timing, WS hang, missing URL assert) | PR #10617 addresses all 5 failures |
| **Nightly Release** | GitHub API secondary rate limit (transient) | Manual re-run 25013124055 succeeded ✅ |

### PR #10617 Review — Fix remaining Playwright E2E test failures

**Playwright fixes (✅ correct):**
- `UpdateSettings.spec.ts`: Replaced hanging `firstWsReady` Promise with bounded `expect.poll` (5s timeout)
- `find-and-search.spec.ts`: Added explicit waits for search input + sidebar visibility before keyboard shortcut
- `not-found.spec.ts`: Added URL assertion (`toHaveURL(/\/($|\?)/)`) after redirect, before checking sidebar
- `post-login-dashboard-ux.spec.ts`: Re-locate sidebar after navigation, add visibility check before click
- `ResolutionMemory.spec.ts`: Added `mockApiMe` for AuthProvider, fixed selector `data-tour="ai-missions-toggle"`
- `RBACExplorer.spec.ts`: Added `waitForRBACDemoFindings` helper (waits for 'dev-team' text)
- `page-coverage.spec.ts`: Replaced bespoke `setupDemoMode` with shared helper
- `dashboard-perf.spec.ts`: Added `CI_TOLERANCE_PCT` multiplier for CI runner variance

**⚠️ Magic number regression (non-blocking):**
PR also reverts ~12 named constants from #10616 back to inline magic numbers across 5 card files (Checkers, MatchGame, CardWrapper, StockMarketTicker, UpgradeStatus). These are game/animation timings, not business logic — low severity but violates "No Magic Numbers" convention. Should be re-extracted in follow-up.

**CI status:** Build ✅, Lint ✅, CodeQL ✅, TTFI gate ✅, Builds (amd64+arm64) ✅
**Recommendation:** Merge to fix RED Playwright indicator. Magic number follow-up is P3.

### Actions
- **PR #10611** (sseClient unhandled rejections) — merged to main ✅
- **PR #10612** (73 Playwright E2E test failures) — created, CI running

    5. Fixed route registration order in CardChat, added stateful sharing mocks
    6. Fixed Sidebar test: events is discoverable, not default sidebar item
- Nightly issues #10435 (consistency-test) and #10436 (unit-test) already closed

**Root Cause:** Two cascading failures on main after PRs #10543/#10550 bumped `k8s.io/api` + `apimachinery` to v0.36.0 without matching `client-go` and `apiextensions-apiserver`:

1. **k8s dependency mismatch** — `client-go@v0.35.4` imports packages removed from `k8s.io/api@v0.36.0` (`autoscaling/v2beta1`, `autoscaling/v2beta2`, `scheduling/v1alpha1`). Breaks `go build`, `go test`, and all CI that compiles Go.
2. **Dockerfile Go 1.25 → 1.26** — `go.mod` requires `go 1.26.0` but Dockerfile used `golang:1.25-alpine`. Docker builds fail at `go mod download`.

### Actions
- Identified root cause across 6+ failing workflows (Build and Deploy KC, Go Tests, Startup Smoke, Auth Login Smoke, Console App Smoke, Post-Merge Build Verification)
- PR #10606 already existed with go.mod fix (client-go + apiextensions-apiserver → v0.36.0)
- **Pushed Dockerfile fix** (Go 1.25→1.26) to PR #10606 branch (`fe952b78c`)
- PR #10606 CI results (before Dockerfile fix): Go Tests ✅, fullstack-smoke ✅, cross-platform builds ✅, Docker builds ❌
- Updated PR #10606 description to include Dockerfile fix and link #10599
- Verified locally: `go build ./...` ✅, `go test ./...` ✅ (all packages pass)
- All workflow GO_VERSION env vars already at 1.26 (PR #10593 merged earlier)

### Workflow Status (latest on main, commit 424ffd0)
| Workflow | Status | Root Cause |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Build and Deploy KC | ❌ FAIL | k8s dep mismatch + Dockerfile Go 1.25 |
| Go Tests | ❌ FAIL | k8s dep mismatch |
| Startup Smoke | ❌ FAIL | Dockerfile Go 1.25 (Docker build) |
| Auth Login Smoke | ❌ FAIL (intermittent) | Go build failure cascading |
| Console App Smoke | ❌ FAIL | k8s dep mismatch (rewards classifier) |

| Nightly Test Suite | ❌ FAIL | Issues #10435/#10436 (pre-existing) |
| Release | ❌ FAIL | GitHub API secondary rate limit (transient) |

### Playwright Nightly (webkit)
- 162 passed, 13 failed, 8 flaky — **webkit-only** timeouts
- Failures in: Sidebar navigation, Clusters page, Dashboard card management, Events refresh
- Pattern: `locator.click: Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded` — webkit rendering latency
- Not related to Go/Dockerfile issues — separate webkit stability problem

### Release
- goreleaser compare API → 403 secondary rate limit (transient)
- Previous 4 runs before that succeeded — will auto-recover
- PR #10580 (changelog github→git fix) already merged

### Coverage
- Coverage Gate: GREEN (PR checks pass)
- Badge: 89% < 91% target
- PR #10601 (29 useCached hook tests) just merged — may push coverage up

### Open PRs
- **#10606** — 🐛 k8s dep alignment + Dockerfile fix (CRITICAL, unblocks all RED workflows)
- **#10553** — dependabot apiextensions-apiserver bump (superseded by #10606)
- **#10552** — dependabot client-go bump (superseded by #10606)
- **#10545** — dependabot prometheus/common bump (safe to merge after #10606)

### Blockers
- PR #10606 must merge to unblock Build and Deploy, Go Tests, Startup Smoke, Auth Smoke
- Dockerfile fix just pushed — awaiting CI verification on PR #10606
- Playwright webkit failures need separate investigation

### Next
- Monitor PR #10606 CI (Docker build should now pass with Dockerfile fix)
- Merge #10606 once CI green → unblocks 6+ workflows
- Close dependabot #10552/#10553 (superseded)
- Merge #10545 (prometheus/common) after #10606
- Investigate webkit Playwright timeouts separately

### PR Sweep Status

**AI-Authored PRs (author=clubanderson):**
- 9 total open
- Attempted rebase of 5 conflicting ADOPTERS.md PRs (8187, 7889, 4043, 4040, 4039)
- 2 rebased cleanly (adopters/kubevirt, adopters/chaos-mesh)
- 3 have massive conflicts (kairos, kubean, harbor — appear to be very old forks with huge divergence)
  - Recommend: Either close these stale PRs or contact branch maintainers for reconciliation

**Community PRs:**
- To review (part of complete PR sweep)

### Actions This Pass

 Completed:
1. Health check: All critical systems green
2. Deploy verified: vllm/pokprod both successful
3. PR #10417 fixes confirmed merged
4. Nightly Compliance confirmed passing (was running, now done)
5. Attempted PR conflict resolution (2 succeeded, 3 too stale)

1. Coverage re-run (clean state) — monitoring
2. Comprehensive PR sweep (flagged stale branches for human decision)

### Issues Found

1. **Playwright Nightly from old commit:** Not a problem (fixes merged, next run will use new code)
2. **Stale PR branches (3):** kubean/kairos/harbor branches have massive conflicts suggesting very old forks — may need manual intervention or closure
3. **Coverage report generation:** First attempt failed; re-running with clean state

### Next Steps

1. Wait for coverage completion (will report pass/fail + percentage)
2. If below 91%: write new tests and open PR
3. Finalize PR sweep (community review + stale PR decisions)
4. Close pass bead with summary
5. Write exec summary


## Pass 27 — FINAL STATUS

### Findings

#### MANDATORY ITEM (B.5) — CI Workflow Health
**CRITICAL:** Console App Roundtrip workflow failing for 5+ consecutive days.

- **Last failure:** 2026-04-27T07:01:13Z (this pass)
- **Issue opened:** #10425 (auto-generated failure issue with runbook)
- **Root cause:** GitHub issue #10424 created successfully, but read-back/attribution check times out at "Read attempt 1/3" after 5s wait
- **Likely causes:** 
  1. GitHub API indexing lag (issue not yet searchable after 5s)
  2. GitHub App credentials expired or rotated
  3. App installation revoked or permissions changed
  4. Private key mismatch between secret and GitHub App settings
- **Triage:** Requires human investigation (check GitHub App settings, credentials, installation status)
- **Blocker filed:** reviewer-a1q (P1: kubestellar-console-bot roundtrip failing 3 days)

#### Nightly Workflows
- **Nightly Test Suite:** In-progress (started 06:47:11Z)
- **Nightly Playwright:** Expected RED from pre-merge commit; should PASS on next run (PR #10417 fixes deployed)
- **Nightly Release:** Scheduled job in-progress

#### Deploy Health
- ✅ vLLM: Deploy successful, pods ready
- ✅ PokProd: Deploy successful, pods ready

#### PR Sweep
- 9 open PRs (all authored by clubanderson)
- **All 9 PRs have `hold` labels** → Protected by hard rule, cannot merge/modify

### Actions Taken

1. ✅ Created pass 30 bead (reviewer-w7t)
2. ✅ Detected P1 fix PR #10426 merged (console-app-roundtrip error handling)
3 Manually triggered Console App Roundtrip workflow test (run 24981779849). 
4. 🟢 Coverage measurement started (waiting for completion)
5. 🟡 PR sweep: All 9 AI-authored PRs on hold (protected by hard rule)

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor roundtrip test run** — check if fix resolves issue
2. **Wait for coverage measurement** — if completed, assess result and file PR if < 91%
3. **Nightly tests** — expected to complete/pass overnight
4. **Close P1 blocker once roundtrip passes** — after 2 consecutive successful runs

### Beads Status
- `reviewer-w7t` → status: **in_progress** (pass 30)
- `reviewer-a1q` → status: **open** (P1: awaiting roundtrip test result)


### Pass 30 Continuation (2026-04-27 07:20-07:30)

**Update:** Manual roundtrip test STILL FAILING after PR #10426 merge!

Issue #10427 created and read back successfully, but Python attribution script gets "ERROR: empty response" due to broken pipe when processing large JSON from stdin.

**New diagnosis:**
- Issue creation: ✅ Working (issue #10427 created)
- Issue read-back: ✅ Working (HTTP 200 with full issue data)
- Python parsing: ❌ BROKEN — "write error: Broken pipe" when piping large JSON to Python
- Root cause: Shell buffer overflow or pipe size limit when piping large API response to Python subprocess

**P1 blocker remains open** — PR #10426 fix was incomplete. The issue is not the read timeout, but broken pipe in the Python parsing step.

**Next fix needed:**
- Increase pipe buffer or use temp file instead of stdin for JSON
- OR use curl's built-in JSON parsing (-J flag or similar)
- OR split response into smaller chunks before piping to Python


### Pass 30 Final Summary

**Duration:** 2026-04-27 07:11–07:35 (~25 minutes)

**Major Findings:**

1. ✅ **PR #10426 Merged** (console-app-roundtrip error handling improvements)
   - Added debugging with `set -x`
   - Improved error capture and reporting
   - But INCOMPLETE: Didn't fix the underlying broken pipe issue

2. 🔴 **Root Cause Identified** (second pass diagnosis)
   - Issue: Piping large JSON to Python via `echo "$JSON" | python3 <<'PY'...`
   - Cause: Shell buffer limits on pipes cause broken pipe errors
   - Symptom: Python gets "ERROR: empty response" despite successful HTTP 200 read

3. ✅ **PR #10429 Created** (broken pipe fix)
   - Writes JSON to temp file instead of piping via stdin
   - Python reads from file directly
   - Cleaner error handling, should resolve 5-day failure
